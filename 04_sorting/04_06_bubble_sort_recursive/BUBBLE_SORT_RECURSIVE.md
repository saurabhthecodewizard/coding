# Problem Name 
Bubble Sort Recursive

## Problem Description

Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Bubble sorting algorithm with recursion.

## Difficulty - Medium

## Time Complexity
O(N2) for the worst and average cases and O(N) for the best case. Here, N = size of the array.

## Space Complexity
O(N) auxiliary stack space.

## Example 1:
```
Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: N=5, array[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Output: 1,2,3,4,5
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```
