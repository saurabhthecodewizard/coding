# Problem Name 
Merge Sort

## Problem Description

Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Merge sorting algorithm.

## Example 1:
```
Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: N=7,arr[]={3,2,8,5,1,4,23}
Output: 1,2,3,4,5,8,23
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 23
```
