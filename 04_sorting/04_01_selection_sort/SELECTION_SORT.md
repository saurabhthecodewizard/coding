# Problem Name 
Selection Sort

## Problem Description

Given an array of N integers, write a program to implement the Selection sorting algorithm.

## Time Complexity
O(N2), (where N = size of the array), for the best, worst, and average cases.
Reason: If we carefully observe, we can notice that the outer loop, say i, is running from 0 to n-2 i.e. n-1 times, and for each i, the inner loop j runs from i to n-1. For, i = 0, the inner loop runs n-1 times, for i = 1, the inner loop runs n-2 times, and so on. So, the total steps will be approximately the following: (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + ……..+ 3 + 2 + 1. The summation is approximately the sum of the first n natural numbers i.e. (n*(n+1))/2. The precise time complexity will be O(n2/2 + n/2). Previously, we have learned that we can ignore the lower values as well as the constant coefficients. So, the time complexity is O(n2). Here the value of n is N i.e. the size of the array.

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: N = 6, array[] = {13,46,24,52,20,9}
Output: 9,13,20,24,46,52
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 9, 13, 20, 24, 46, 52
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: N=5, array[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Output: 1,2,3,4,5
Explanation: After sorting the array is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
