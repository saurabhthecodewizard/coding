# Problem Name 
Reverse Integer - [Leetcode - 7](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

## Problem Description

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

## Example 1:
```
Input: N = 123
Output: 321
Explanation: The reverse of 123 is 321
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: N = 234
Output: 432
Explanation: The reverse of 234 is 432
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: x = -123
Output: -321
```
