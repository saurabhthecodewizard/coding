## Problem Description

Find the Greatest Common Divisor of two numbers.

## Difficulty - Easy

## Time Complexity
O(log ɸ min(a,b)), where ɸ is 1.61.

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: num1 = 4, num2 = 8
Output: 4
Explanation: Since 4 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: Since 3 is the greatest number which divides both num1 and num2.
