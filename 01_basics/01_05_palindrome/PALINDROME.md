## Problem Description

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome, and false otherwise.

## Difficulty - Easy

## Time Complexity
O(log n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Example 3:
```
Input: x = 10
Output: false
