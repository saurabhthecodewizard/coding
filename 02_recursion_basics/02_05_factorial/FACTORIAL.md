Given a number X,  print its factorial.

To obtain the factorial of a number, it has to be multiplied by all the whole numbers preceding it. More precisely X! = X*(X-1)*(X-2) â€¦ 1.

Note: X  is always a positive number. 

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: X = 5
Output: 120
Explanation: 5! = 5*4*3*2*1
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: X = 3
