# Problem Name 
Reverse Array

## Problem Description

You are given an array. The task is to reverse the array and print it. 

## Time Complexity
O(n / 2)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: N = 5, arr[] = {5,4,3,2,1}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5}
Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: N=6 arr[] = {10,20,30,40}
Output: {40,30,20,10}
Explanation: Since the order of elements gets reversed the first element will occupy the fifth position, the second element occupies the fourth position and so on.
