# Problem Name 
Union of Sorted Arrays

## Problem Description

Given two sorted arrays, arr1, and arr2 of size n and m. Find the union of two sorted arrays.

The union of two arrays can be defined as the common and distinct elements in the two arrays.NOTE: Elements in the union should be in ascending order.

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Example 1:
Input:
n = 5,m = 5.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5}  
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5}
Output:
 {1,2,3,4,5}

Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distinct Elements in arr1 are : 1
Distinct Elements in arr2 are : No distinct elements.
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5}
```

## Example 2:
```
Input:
n = 10,m = 7.
arr1[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
arr2[] = {2,3,4,4,5,11,12}
Output: {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}

Explanation: 
Common Elements in arr1 and arr2  are:  2,3,4,5
Distinct Elements in arr1 are : 1,6,7,8,9,10
Distinct Elements in arr2 are : 11,12
Union of arr1 and arr2 is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12}
