# Problem Name 
Find second smallest and second largest element in an array

## Problem Description

Given an array, find the second smallest and second largest element in the array. Print ‘-1’ in the event that either of them doesn’t exist.

## Difficulty - Easy

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,4,7,7,5]
Output: Second Smallest : 2
	Second Largest : 5
Explanation: The elements are as follows 1,2,3,5,7,7 and hence second largest of these is 5 and second smallest is 2
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: [1]
Output: Second Smallest : -1
	Second Largest : -1
Explanation: Since there is only one element in the array, it is the largest and smallest element present in the array. There is no second largest or second smallest element present.
