# Problem Name 
Rotate Array - [Leetcode - 189](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-array/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

## Difficulty - Medium

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```
