## Problem Description

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

## Difficulty - Medium

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(1)

## Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

## Example 2:
```
