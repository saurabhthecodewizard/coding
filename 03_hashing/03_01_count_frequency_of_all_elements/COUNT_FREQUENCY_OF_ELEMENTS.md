# Problem Name 
Count frequency of each element in the array

## Problem Description

Given an array, we have found the number of occurrences of each element in the array. 

## Time Complexity
O(n)

## Space Complexity
O(n)

## Example 1:
```
Input: arr[] = {10,5,10,15,10,5};
Output: 
    10  3
	5  2
    15  1
Explanation:-
            10 occurs 3 times in the array
            5 occurs 2 times in the array
            15 occurs 1 time in the array
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: arr[] = {2,2,3,4,4,2};
Output: 
    2  3
	3  1
    4  2
Explanation:- 
            2 occurs 3 times in the array
	        3 occurs 1 time in the array
            4 occurs 2 time in the array
